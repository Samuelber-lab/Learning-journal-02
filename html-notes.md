## HTML and CSS
HTML per se is code/ language that we use to tell the computer to do what we want to have on our webpage. The HTML code is made up of two main parts, i.e., elements and tags. Elements are those characters or words in blue, while tags are the opening and closing tag arround the  information. The closing tag should always bear a forward slash in it, just before the element. The codes that we use on HTML are diffrent from those of markdown. 
For instance,
In markdown we use #, ## ... for heading 1, heading 2 etc, respectively. In contrast, in HTML we use <h1>heading-1</h1>, <h2>heading-2</h2>. Unlike what is in the markdown, we need to embade a non-heading (block text) as  <p>zzzzzzzzz</p>.
Moreover, the whole body of text (heading and non-heading) should be enclosed in between <body>...</body> as like </body>heading + non-heading</body>. Finally, start and end of an HTML file should be enclosed by <html>...</html>. Hence, the overall structure of an HTML file looks like as follows:
<html>
<body>
<h1>.....</h1>
<p>..............................</p>
<h2>.....</h2>
<p>..............................</p>
</body>
</html>
